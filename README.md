# AI-Powered Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 🚀  
[![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-Repository-blue)](https://github.com/RohanCyberOps/IDS)  
An advanced **Cyber Security Tool** that leverages **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to monitor network traffic and detect potential threats or intrusions in real time. This project is designed to enhance network security by identifying malicious activities with high precision.

---

## 🌟 Features  
- **Real-Time Monitoring:** Continuously scans network traffic for unusual patterns.  
- **AI-Based Detection:** Utilizes machine learning models to classify threats.  
- **Customizable Rules:** Fine-tune detection parameters to suit your environment.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clear and detailed reports for network administrators.  
- **Extensive Threat Database:** Identifies known and zero-day attacks.

## 🔧 Installation  

1. **Clone the repository:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/RohanCyberOps/IDS.git
   cd IDS
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the application:**  
   ```bash
   python src/ai_engine.py
   ```

---

## ⚙️ Configuration  
Modify the configuration in the `config.json` file:  
```json
{
    "network_interface": "eth0",
    "alert_threshold": 0.75,
    "log_file": "logs/ids.log"
}
```

---

## 🧪 Datasets  
- **Training Data:** Located in the `data/` folder. You can use your own datasets or publicly available ones like [CICIDS](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/index.html).  
- **Pre-Trained Models:** Found in the `models/` folder. Replace them with updated models if required.

---

## 🤖 How It Works  
1. **Traffic Monitoring:** Captures live network traffic.  
2. **Preprocessing:** Cleans and processes traffic data.  
3. **AI Model:** Detects anomalies using supervised learning.  
4. **Alerts:** Generates reports and real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
